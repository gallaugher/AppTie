# AppTie
Arduino Sketch for Adafruit Flora and Bluefruit LE module - control wired-together sewable Neopixels from the Bluefruit app.

Not the prettiest code, but allowed me to power a Flora + Bluetooth LE
module to color pick & send animation signals to animate a necktie.
I was trying to do something fun for Parents Day at Boston College.

I used the same wiring scheme for the sewable neopixels that you'll
find in Adafruit Sparkle Skirt:

And I wired the Flora Bluetooth LE module to the Flora with this
wiring scheme:
